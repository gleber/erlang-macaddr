To get a single MAC address

     "00:32:7c:02:34:61"

  2> macaddr:address_list().
     ["00:32:7c:02:34:61", "00:2d:05:04:55:63"]



How do I build it?
---------------------------
make
make tests



How do I install it?
---------------------------
After building it, there are some options on using it.

1. You can modify your code path by adding the following like to ~/.erlang
    code:add_pathz("/wherever/you/built/macaddr").

2. Use the macaddr directory as-is in your erlang/lib.
     sudo mv macaddr /usr/local/lib/erlang/lib

3. Clone from git in your erlang/lib directory and keep macaddr up to date using git
     cd /usr/local/lib/erlang/lib
     sudo git clone  <macaddr git url> macaddr
     cd macaddr
     sudo make
